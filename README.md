# road-to-react
This repository is to document and outline the journey of me learning react.js and next.js to create my portfolio website.
This project would make use of various JavaScript Libraries such as G-SAP.js, Framer Motion, Animate on Scroll and Tailwind CSS.
This project is an effort of me to modernize my webdev stack so the first file would entail a rough html version of the Portfolio page and the next is the full page in react.
The full Tech Stack for this project is React.js,PHP,Tailwind CSS, Javascript and PostgreSQL.
